# PokerAndBlackJack
Poker and Black Jack in made with Android Studio

I have created an application that allows users to play both BlackJack and a simplified poker game against a computer opponent. The project was created using in Android Studio and uses Java and XML.

Getting Started

New users need to first pull the code down from github and ensure that they have Android Studio installed

Prerequisites

1. Android Studio with an emulator setup
2. (optional) If you wish to install and run the app on your phone you will also need a USB data cable and a phone with development mode enabled

Installing
1. Pull the code down off of github using "git clone" in the terminal
2. Open in Android studio
3. Run the code on either the emulator or your phone

Playing the games

BlackJack
Players start with two cards and the ability to see one of the computers cards. Players must try to get 21 or as close to 21 as possible. They can chose hit to recieve another card or hold to keep their current cards. Play will continue until somebody goes over, gets 21 or both players hold. A score keeps track of the games won by the computer and the player

Poker
Players start with two cards. They can then make an initial bet or fold. The computer will then bet and either bet the same or higher than the player. The player can then choose to match the computer or fold. This pattern continues untill 5 cards are dealt or 1 player folds. The winnings are then transferred to the winning player. Players can choose to play again or finish. If they play again their money will be transferred over to the new game.
